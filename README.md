# Describing the app

We developed our app with the goal of providing structure and facilitating a more convenient way to manage plants in a greenhouse. The app helps users keep track of their plants' growth phases and watering schedules. This is achieved by enabling users to add plants, where they add information about the growth phase and select the watering frequency. To distinguish between different plants, each plant is assigned a unique user-created nickname. The user can at all times edit or delete the plant from the overview. When a user adds a plant to the system, the app automatically records the date of entry. As time progresses, the app calculates the next scheduled watering date based on the plant's initial entry date and the chosen watering frequency. Users will receive timely notifications when it's time to water their plants. When watering is registered in the app, the user will receive a subsequent notification when the next watering interval has elapsed. With this calender-based system, it is also possible for the user to see the how long the plants have lived.
